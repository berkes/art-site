I am Bèr Kessels, a freelance software developer with a passion for creative coding and generative art.

This site showcases my experiments with **algorithmic art** and **creative code**. I explore generative patterns, fractals, and visual systems using various languages and frameworks.

My work here spans multiple technologies: Rust with Nannou, Processing, JavaScript, and TypeScript. Each experiment is an opportunity to blend technical precision with artistic exploration.

You'll find sketches that range from flowing organic forms to structured geometric patterns. Some are studies from courses, others are original explorations. All share a focus on code as a medium for creative expression.

The code for these experiments lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/berkes/art), available under open source licenses.
