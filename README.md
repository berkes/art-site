## Prerequisites

- [Podman](https://podman.io/) (or Docker with minor modifications to Makefile)
- Make

## Getting Started

### Installation

Verify Hugo is available:

```bash
make install
```

### Local Development

Run a local development server with live reload:

```bash
make preview
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Building

```bash
make build
```

The built site will be generated in the `public/` directory.

### Cleaning

```bash
make clean
```

```

## Deployment

Deployment is automated through GitHub Actions. Simply push to the `main` branch:

```bash
git push origin main
```

The CI pipeline will:
1. Build the Hugo site with minification
2. Upload the build artifact
3. Deploy to Scaleway Object Storage

### Manual Deployment

```bash
make deploy
```

Note: This will remind you that deployment is handled by CI/CD.

## Configuration

Site configuration is managed in `hugo.toml`:

- **Base URL**: `https://art.berk.es`
- **Language**: English (en-us)
- **Title**: Bèr `berkes` Kessels' art experiments

## Docker/Podman

The project uses Podman for containerized builds. All Hugo commands run inside the `hugomods/hugo` container to ensure consistent builds across environments.
